## Development

### Tips

While developing React `[HMR]` console messages can get in the way. Here is a snippet to put on chrome devtools to filter those:

```regex
/^(?!.*\[HMR\])/
```

And for the network tab this may be useful:

```regex
/^(?!.*\/\_next\/on\-demand\-entries\-ping\?|\/\_next\/webpack)/
```
